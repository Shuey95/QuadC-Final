# QuadC-Final
My project was working with Microsofts Kinect sensor. Through C++ frameworks (OpenFrameworks), and a few oibraries I've managed to create a visualization that's detected by the kinect. The sensor inputs data into the created program and outputs a beautiful visualization. A crucial library in this program was ofxFlowTools, an openCv library that uses computer vision. I borrowed their shaders, changed em up a bit, so on. The code will be updated and posted on Github.
